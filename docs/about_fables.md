# About Fables

## What is a fable?

A fable is a short story, often featuring animals, plants, or inanimate objects that are personified (given human characteristics), and it conveys a moral lesson or ethical principle. Fables are a form of storytelling that is simple, yet profound, making them suitable for teaching values or lessons, especially to children.

Characteristics of Fables:
1. Brevity: Fables are concise and to the point, making them easy to remember and retell.
2. Moral Lesson: They often end with a clear takeaway or moral, which might be explicitly stated (e.g., “The moral of the story is…”).
3. Personification: Non-human characters, such as animals or objects, are given human traits to make the story engaging and relatable.
4. Universal Themes: Fables often deal with themes like honesty, kindness, cleverness, or the consequences of greed, laziness, or dishonesty.
5. Timeless Appeal: They transcend cultures and eras, making them relevant across generations.

## Examples of famous fables
1. The Tortoise and the Hare (Aesop)
  - A slow and steady tortoise wins a race against an overconfident hare.
  - Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.
2. The Fox and the Grapes (Aesop):
  - A fox fails to reach some grapes and dismisses them as sour.
  - Moral: It’s easy to despise what you cannot have (origin of “sour grapes”).
3. The Ant and the Grasshopper (Aesop):
  - An ant works hard during summer, while a grasshopper idles. The ant is prepared for winter, while the grasshopper suffers.
  - Moral: Prepare for the future instead of only living for the moment.

### Fables in Romanian culture
In Romanian culture, “fabule” are similar and often reflect local traditions or wisdom, such as those by Grigore Alexandrescu, a Romanian fabulist. His works, like “Boul și Vițelul” (“The Ox and the Calf”), carry moral lessons rooted in Romanian society.

## Merits for synthetic dataset generation
Fables make a good inspiration for a NLP-focused dataset, as they are inherently compact, use simple language, and serve to convey reasoning or moral understanding, which aligns with the goals of training small language models.

#### 1. The Ant and the Butterfly

Once there was a busy ant named Ana. She worked all day collecting crumbs for winter. One day, she saw a beautiful butterfly dancing in the sun. “Come dance with me, Ana,” said the butterfly. “I can’t. I must prepare for the cold,” said Ana. The butterfly laughed and flew away. When winter came, the butterfly had no food. She knocked on Ana’s door. “Please, Ana, can you share your crumbs?” Ana gave the butterfly some crumbs. “Next time, work when you can,” she said. The butterfly nodded, feeling thankful and wiser.

Moral: Prepare today for what you’ll need tomorrow.

#### 2. The Lazy Fox and the Clever Crow

Once a fox saw a crow with a big piece of cheese in her beak. “Dear Crow,” said the fox, “your feathers are so shiny. Surely, you have the sweetest voice!” The crow smiled and opened her beak to sing, but the cheese fell to the ground. The fox grabbed the cheese and said, “Thank you for the meal!” The crow felt foolish and said, “Flattery is no friend.”

Moral: Beware of those who only praise you to get what they want.

### Romanian (RO)

#### 1. Furnica și Fluturele

Într-o zi, o furnică pe nume Ana aduna firimituri pentru iarnă. Fluturele, frumos și colorat, dansa în razele soarelui. “Vino să dansezi cu mine, Ana,” spuse fluturele. “Nu pot. Trebuie să mă pregătesc pentru frig,” răspunse furnica. Fluturele râse și zbură mai departe. Când a venit iarna, fluturele nu avea mâncare. A bătut la ușa furnicii. “Te rog, Ana, îmi poți da niște firimituri?” Furnica i-a dat câteva. “Data viitoare, muncește la timp,” spuse ea. Fluturele a înțeles și i-a mulțumit.

Morală: Pregătește-te azi pentru ce vei avea nevoie mâine.

#### 2. Vulpea leneșă și Corbul isteț

O vulpe vicleană văzu un corb cu o bucată mare de brânză în cioc. “Dragă Corbule,” spuse vulpea, “penele tale sunt atât de strălucitoare! Cu siguranță ai și o voce minunată.” Corbul zâmbi și deschise ciocul să cânte, dar brânza căzu pe jos. Vulpea o luă repede și spuse: “Mulțumesc pentru masă!” Corbul oftă și spuse: “Lingusirea nu este prieten adevărat.”

Morală: Ferește-te de cei care te laudă doar pentru a obține ce vor.
